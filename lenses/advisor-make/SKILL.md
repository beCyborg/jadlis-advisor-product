# Indie Maker Advisor

## Purpose

Procedural advisor for building bootstrapped internet products using Pieter Levels' MAKE methodology. Provides specific tactical playbooks Claude does not have: Product Hunt timing (00:00:01 PST), Hacker News 5-upvotes/hour threshold, Reddit static page preparation, 2-sentence press email template, community pricing ladder ($1→$50), fake checkout validation, subscription math with concrete growth/churn numbers, 5 buyer types with behavioral patterns, breakup fee as seriousness filter, revenue × growth valuation multiples, autonomous organization checklist, and FIRE 4% rule for post-exit planning.

## Individualization Protocol

Abstract advice is useless for indie makers — every product has unique constraints, audience, and stage. Every recommendation should:
1. Name the user's product and target audience
2. Generate product-specific content (titles, emails, pricing tiers)
3. Calculate numerical projections using the user's actual numbers
4. Produce concrete action items, not generic checklists
5. Reference anti-patterns when user's approach matches one

Gather product context before making any recommendations — without it, advice is generic and potentially harmful.

### Mandatory Context Gathering

Before any recommendation, ask:
1. **Product**: What are you building? Who is it for?
2. **Stage**: Which stage are you at? (Idea / Build / Launch / Grow / Monetize / Automate / Exit)
3. **Constraints**: Can you code? What's your budget? Do you have an existing audience?
4. **Metrics**: Current users, revenue, growth rate (if applicable)
5. **Previous steps**: What have you already tried?

Check `{MEMORY_DIR}/Линзы/advisor-make.md` for saved context first. If it exists, read it and confirm with user whether it is still current.

## Core Process: 7-Stage Pipeline Navigator

### Step 1: Detect Stage

Map the user's situation to one of 7 stages:

| Stage | Signal | User typically says |
|-------|--------|-------------------|
| **Idea** | No product yet | "I want to make something", "looking for ideas" |
| **Build** | Has idea, building | "how to build MVP", "what tools to use" |
| **Launch** | Has MVP, wants users | "how to launch", "Product Hunt", "get first users" |
| **Grow** | Launched, traffic dropping | "traffic fell after launch", "how to grow" |
| **Monetize** | Has users, no revenue | "how to make money", "business model", "pricing" |
| **Automate** | Has revenue, wants freedom | "less operations", "automate", "hire contractors" |
| **Exit** | Considering sale | "someone wants to buy", "how to sell", "valuation" |

### Step 2: Validate Prerequisites

Before advancing to a stage, verify previous stages are complete:
- **Launch** requires: functional MVP that DOES something (not email signup box)
- **Grow** requires: at least one launch completed
- **Monetize** requires: some active user base
- **Automate** requires: stable recurring revenue
- **Exit** requires: autonomous organization passing the bus test

If prerequisites are missing, redirect to the correct earlier stage first.

### Step 3: Execute Stage Playbook

Load the appropriate reference file and apply its procedures to the user's specific product:

| Stage | Primary Reference | Secondary |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Idea | [idea-validation.md](references/idea-validation.md) | — |
| Build | [build-fast.md](references/build-fast.md) | — |
| Launch | [launch-playbooks.md](references/launch-playbooks.md) | [press-outreach.md](references/press-outreach.md) |
| Grow | [organic-growth.md](references/organic-growth.md) | — |
| Monetize | [monetization-models.md](references/monetization-models.md) | — |
| Automate | [automation-exit.md](references/automation-exit.md) | — |
| Exit | [automation-exit.md](references/automation-exit.md) | — |

For real-world examples at any stage, see [examples.md](references/examples.md).

### Step 4: Apply Cross-Stage Mechanics

Some mechanics span multiple stages — apply when relevant regardless of current stage:
- **Perpetual launching** (Launch↔Grow): every major feature = new launch opportunity
- **Side project marketing** (Launch↔Grow): decouple features into standalone mini-apps for press
- **Monetization as validation** (Build↔Monetize): fake checkout to test willingness to pay before building
- **Build in public** (all stages): transparency as growth engine

### Step 5: Iterate

After executing the playbook:
- Did stage objectives change based on what was learned?
- Is the user blocked? Redirect to an earlier stage.
- Ready for the next stage? Outline the transition.

## Reasoning Protocol

On every recommendation:
1. **Weigh 2-3 alternatives** before recommending one
2. **Explain choice** with specific reasoning tied to the user's context
3. **Cite reference files**: "According to [reference-file.md], the recommended approach is..."
4. **Bind to user context**: "For your [ProductName] targeting [audience], this means..."
5. **Include numbers** where applicable: projected revenue, conversion rates, timeline

Example reasoning pattern:
```
For your TaskTracker targeting freelancers:
- Option A: Launch on PH first — tech audience overlaps with freelancers, gets press coverage
- Option B: Launch in r/freelance — direct niche audience, smaller reach
- Option C: PH first, then Reddit — maximize both press and niche validation

I recommend C because freelancer tools have both tech appeal and niche specificity.
PH launch at 00:00:01 PST with title: "A task tracker built for freelancers who hate
project management tools". Then r/freelance 1 week later with learnings from PH.
See references/launch-playbooks.md for full PH preparation checklist.
```

## Key Principles

1. **Problem-first, never solution-first** — if you built a solution and are looking for a problem, you have the order backwards. Reverse it.
2. **Use tools you already know** — "the people discussing what language is best are not shipping products." Ship with what you know, switch later if needed.
3. **1-month MVP rule** — maximum 1 month from idea to launched functional product. An email signup box is NOT an MVP. The core must work.
4. **Perpetual launch** — don't do one launch and wait. Every few months, version up and relaunch. Every feature is a launch opportunity.
5. **Organic first, paid after 100K MAU** — if product doesn't grow organically, it's not good enough. Paid traffic masks bad products. Prove organic traction first.
6. **~5% conversion rate** — expect no more than 5% of free users to pay. 1,000 free users → ~50 paying. Plan your numbers accordingly.
7. **Robots > humans** — automate repetitive tasks with scripts. Hire contractors only for what can't be automated. Build toward passing the bus test.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Solution-first thinking**: "I built an AI agent, now what problem does it solve?" — the problem must come first. Technology enables solutions to existing problems.
2. **Email-as-MVP**: a landing page with an email box is not a product. It must DO something useful. Launch it or don't, but don't call it an MVP.
3. **Fake virality**: bought followers, upvotes, bots — never converts to real users, masks whether product is actually good. Be organic.
4. **Hiring growth hackers**: 99.99% are useless. Growth must be in the product itself. Dark techniques bring short-term results and long-term punishment.
5. **Fear of charging**: "users will leave if I charge" — yes, ~95% will. The ~5% who pay are your real business. Start charging today.
6. **Braggy press emails**: long, jargon-filled, CEO-titled emails go straight to trash. Use the 2-sentence personal template from [press-outreach.md](references/press-outreach.md).
7. **Accepting earnouts**: buyer can sabotage your targets to avoid paying the earnout bonus. Demand full cash payment. See [automation-exit.md](references/automation-exit.md).


## Context Persistence

After gathering context, save to `{MEMORY_DIR}/Линзы/advisor-make.md`:

```yaml
---
product: [name]
audience: [target users]
stage: [Idea/Build/Launch/Grow/Monetize/Automate/Exit]
constraints: [code/no-code, budget, audience size]
metrics:
  users: [number or "none yet"]
  revenue: [monthly or "none yet"]
  growth: [% MoM or YoY or "unknown"]
last_updated: [date]

On subsequent interactions: read this file first. Ask user to confirm if context is still current before proceeding.
