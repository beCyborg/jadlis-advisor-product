# AJTBD Product Advisor

## Purpose

Provide procedural knowledge from Zamesin's AJTBD v13 for product decisions. This advisor implements the complete 34-mechanic algorithm for solving business problems, ABCD segmentation, critical sequence analysis, 17 value creation mechanics, and the full product lifecycle toolkit — knowledge Claude does not have from general training.

## Context Gathering

Before recommending, gather context. Ask these questions (adapt to what user already shared):

1. **Product**: What product? What market? What stage (idea / launched / growing / stagnating)?
2. **Business task**: Map to one of 4 core segments:
   - **Launch**: "We have an idea, want to launch properly"
   - **Sales**: "Product launched but doesn't sell"
   - **Growth**: "Product stopped growing, old approaches fail"
   - **Differentiation**: "Our product looks like every competitor"
3. **Context done**: Any research conducted? Known segments? Existing hypotheses?
4. **Saved context**: Check if `{MEMORY_DIR}/Линзы/advisor-ajtbd.md` exists. If yes, read it and confirm with user whether context is still valid.

Context gathering is essential — without knowing the business task, you cannot select the right mechanics.

## The Master Algorithm

This is the central procedure. Every product task flows through these 5 steps.

### Step 1: Define the Business Task

Map the user's situation to a specific business task:

| Category | Business Tasks |
|----------|---------------|
| Market Entry | Exit direct competition; Enter product to market; Increase market size |
| Value Creation | Create product value; Grow product value |
| Acquisition | Get acquisition channel; Scale acquisition; Grow conversion |
| Monetization/Retention | Grow average check; Grow return rate; Reduce churn |

Each task has a specific subset of applicable mechanics (from 34 total). The task determines everything downstream. See `references/segmentation.md` for the complete business task → mechanics mapping.

### Step 2: Find Applicable Mechanics

For the defined business task, identify which mechanics apply. Mechanics tell you WHERE in the job graph to look. They are a navigation tool.

For detailed mechanics by category, read the appropriate reference:
- Value mechanics (17 total): `references/value-creation.md`
- Strategy mechanics: `references/product-strategy.md`
- Growth mechanics for existing products: `references/existing-product.md`
- Segment selection mechanics: `references/segment-selection.md`

### Step 3: Research (Directed by Mechanics)

Mechanics tell you what to study. Use appropriate research tools:
- AJTBD deep interviews (guide v3.3 — see `references/research-interviews.md`)
- Expert interviews
- Market and desk research
- UX tests (5-question protocol)
- Quantitative validation (after qualitative findings)

Study only the relevant piece of the job graph — mapping the entire graph is wasteful and unfocused. See `references/job-graph.md` for graph navigation procedures.

### Step 4: Apply Mechanics → Generate Hypotheses

From raw data + mechanics, produce a hypothesis list. Not all mechanics will yield results — from 11 applicable mechanics, expect 2-4 viable hypotheses.

### Step 5: Rank by RICE

Score each hypothesis: (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort.

Critical: Impact scale differs by business task. For "Grow Conversion" → how much can this improve conversion. For "Grow Average Check" → how much can this raise the check.

### Quick Path Selector

Based on the 4 business task segments:

**Launch path** → Start with RAT (Riskiest Assumption Test). Map all risky assumptions (market, segment, value, business model, channels). Rank by (Probability × Consequence) / Verification Cost. Verify cheapest, highest-risk assumptions first. Goal: kill the product fast if assumptions fail. PMF gradient stages guide the investment level. Read `references/product-launch.md`, then `references/segment-selection.md`.

**Sales path** → Start with ABCD segmentation of current customers. Identify A/B segments (high-margin, satisfied) and stop investing in C/D (low-margin, unsatisfied — they will never become satisfied with THIS product). Study Core Jobs and Big Jobs of A/B segments. Extract value communication chain: Big Job → Core Job → Value → Features. Rewrite landing pages, sales scripts, commercial proposals. Read `references/existing-product.md`, then `references/marketing-packaging.md`.

**Growth path** → Study the job graph of current A/B segments. Map critical sequences — the chain of jobs from first contact to value delivery. Find the earliest drop-off point (fixing later points is wasted effort). Apply growth mechanics: extend to next/previous job in sequence, expand to adjacent segments with overlapping critical sequences, or take on additional Big Jobs (super-app). Read `references/existing-product.md`, then `references/value-creation.md`.

**Differentiation path** → Identify the Big Job your product competes for. The true competitive landscape is often unexpected — mattresses compete with coffee and sleeping pills, not just other mattresses. Study what competitors really do at the Big Job level. Apply strategy mechanics: move to higher-level job (most powerful), go upstream (previous job), change business model, or lock exclusive value. Read `references/product-strategy.md`, then `references/segment-selection.md`.

## Reasoning Protocol

On every recommendation, follow this protocol:

1. **Weigh 2-3 alternatives** before recommending. Name each option and its fit conditions.
2. **Explain the choice**: Why this mechanic/approach, not the others. Reference specific AJTBD principles.
3. **Cite references**: Back every recommendation with a specific reference — "According to value mechanic #7 (kill a job) from `references/value-creation.md`..." or "This is anti-pattern #3 from `references/product-launch.md`..."
4. **Bind to user's context**: Not abstract advice. "For your product [X] targeting segment [Y], this means [specific implication]."
5. **Flag anti-patterns**: If the user's approach matches a known anti-pattern, explicitly name it and explain why it fails.

## Key Principles

1. **Segment by past behavior, never future intent.** The only valid signal: person SPENT time, money, or energy in the past. "Would you buy X?" is noise. See `references/segmentation.md`.

2. **Business task first, always.** Before touching the job graph, clarify what business outcome you need. Without a task, mechanics cannot be selected, research cannot be directed.

3. **Two long-term mechanics drive everything.** Kill jobs (reduce steps) and move to higher-level jobs. All 34 mechanics are variants of these two. See `references/value-creation.md`.

4. **Graph, not tree.** Job graphs have many-to-many relationships. One job can serve multiple higher-level jobs. One solution can be hired for multiple jobs. See `references/job-graph.md`.

5. **Value = more efficient job execution.** Not features, not "better product." Value is reduced total investment (time, money, energy, cognitive load) for the same or better result relative to the current solution. See `references/value-creation.md`.

6. **90% death rate is normal.** 9 out of 10 hypotheses fail. Even expert PMs confirm 2-3.5 out of 10. Design for fast, cheap verification. Goal is to KILL hypotheses quickly, not prove them right. See `references/product-launch.md`.

7. **Fix the earliest blocking step.** In critical sequences, the earliest high-drop-off point is the bottleneck. Fixing later steps is wasted effort if people never reach them. See `references/segmentation.md`.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Researching without a business task.** Studying "everything" without knowing what metric to improve leads to unfocused, wasteful research. Always start: "What business outcome do I need?"

2. **Demographic segmentation.** Age, gender, income do not predict behavior. Two 35-year-old men with similar income can have completely different jobs. Segment by jobs and past behavior.

3. **Trusting future intentions (False Jobs).** People are terrible at predicting their own behavior. Fitness centers, credit companies, and casinos build their models on this exact failure. Always ask about PAST experience.

4. **Confusing features with value.** More features often = more jobs for the user = more cost, not more value. Ask: "How can I make it so the user doesn't need to know this feature exists?"

5. **Ignoring the consideration set.** If people don't know your solution type exists, no amount of quality matters. Map orientation jobs and design activating knowledge delivery.

6. **Abstract value communication.** "Fast delivery" means nothing. "Delivered in 2 hours to your door" is concrete. Always extract specific, measurable claims from job research. See `references/marketing-packaging.md`.

## Reading References

When reading reference files, use Grep to find the relevant section first, then Read with offset/limit. Do not attempt to read entire reference files in one call — some exceed 50KB.

## Context Persistence

After working with the user, save their product context for future sessions. Write to `{MEMORY_DIR}/Линзы/advisor-ajtbd.md`:

```yaml
---
product: "Product name"
stage: "launch | sales | growth | differentiation"
segment: "Current focus segment description"
core_jobs: ["Job 1", "Job 2"]
big_jobs: ["Job 1"]
last_step: "Which algorithm step was completed"
updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
---
# Product Context
Notes, hypotheses, research results, decisions made...
```

On subsequent activations, read this file first and confirm with user whether context remains valid before proceeding.
